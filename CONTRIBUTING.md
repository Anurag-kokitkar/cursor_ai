## üé® Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use ES6+ features
- Prefer `const` over `let` over `var`
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Follow Airbnb style guide (enforced by ESLint)

```javascript
/**
 * Analyzes code for security vulnerabilities
 * @param {string} code - The source code to analyze
 * @param {string} language - Programming language
 * @returns {Promise<Array>} Array of security issues
 */
const analyzeSecurityIssues = async (code, language) => {
  // Implementation
};
```

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Use TypeScript for props (when applicable)
- Follow the component file structure:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { ComponentProps } from './types';
import styles from './Component.module.css';

const Component = ({ prop1, prop2 }) => {
  // Hooks
  // Event handlers
  // Render logic
  
  return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      {/* Component JSX */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Component;
```

### CSS/Styling

- Use Material-UI components when possible
- Follow BEM methodology for custom CSS
- Use CSS modules for component-specific styles
- Responsive design first approach

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

- Test individual functions and components
- Mock external dependencies
- Use descriptive test names
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage

```javascript
describe('AnalysisEngine', () => {
  describe('analyzeComplexity', () => {
    it('should detect high complexity in nested loops', () => {
      const code = `
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
          for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            // nested logic
          }
        }
      `;
      
      const result = analyzeComplexity(code);
      expect(result.complexity).toBeGreaterThan(10);
    });
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests
